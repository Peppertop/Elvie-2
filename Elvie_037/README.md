Elvie #037
==========
This strip appeared in issue #197 of Linux (Pro) Magazine, after it was confirmed that the Democrats' email
server was almost certainly hacked by Russian state actors. This strip is a reworking of, and direct reference
to, our earlier strip (http://peppertop.com/elvie/comic/elvie-017/) which poked fun at the equivalient Western
surveillance machine.
