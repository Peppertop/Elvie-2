Elvie #038
==========
This strip was created in January/February of 2017 and appeared in issue #198 of Linux (Pro) Magazine. It's one of
a pair of satirical strips for which we decided to represent current political events (in this case Brexit) as
though they were the man pages of unix commands. We also decided to abandon our usual Elvie border for these
strips, presenting them just as images of monitors on the page. The Elvie logo, license information and web
address therefore became parts of the monitors' bezel, where you might normally find the manufacturer's logo
and model number.

Also, unlike most of our strips, this one was predominantly created as an SVG image in Inkscape. The monitors'
outlines were created from a trace of an earlier bitmap image, and almost everything else was created and coloured
in Inkscape. The only exception is the reflection of Elvie, which is a raster image as usual.
