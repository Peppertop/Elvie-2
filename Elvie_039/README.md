Elvie #039
==========
This strip was created in February/March of 2017 and appeared in issue #199 of Linux (Pro) Magazine. It's the second
of a pair of satirical strips for which we decided to represent contemporary political events as though they were 
the man pages of Unix commands. At this time Donald Trump had recently been elected, was still talking up his idea
of a wall between the US and Mexico, and was trying to introduce a travel ban for passengers from several mostly
muslim countries.

We also took the opportunity to reference the long-held usage of the word "trump" in the UK.

We also decided to abandon our usual Elvie border for these strips, presenting them just as images of monitors
on the page. In this case the usual Elvie logo was dropped entirely, being replaced with the username at the
top right of the screen; and the license and web address information was implemented as a post-it note stuck
to the monitor's frame.

Also, unlike most of our strips, this one was largely assembled in The GIMP, with Inkscape used to set the
main text.
