Elvie #048
==========
This strip appeared in issue #208 of Linux (Pro) Magazine.

There is a slight anachronism with this strip: It was originally intended to appear far earlier in the
series, but kept getting delayed for various reasons. Consequently the photo being taken in this 
cartoon actually appears four strips earlier, inside the house in Elvie #44!
