Elvie #055
==========
This strip first appeared in issue #215 of Linux (Pro) Magazine. This one was based on the true story of my
own 1984-vintage Cherry keyboard, rescued from a dumpster, cleaned and brought back into service - to the
annoyance of my colleagues at the time.

Because there was no such thing as a 'Windows' (aka 'Super') key back in 1984, I even ended up getting hold
of a small microcontroller on a USB-stick form factor, and programming it to send a suitable keypress when
a button on the board was pressed. It rarely got used, but just occasionally I would come across a piece of
software or functionality that would _only_ work with the Windows key, so the creation of this little dongle
allowed me to continue working with my lovely-to-type-on Cherry keyboard without any loss of modern
functionality.
