Elvie #060
==========
This strip first appeared in issue #220 of Linux (Pro) Magazine, and was the 60th Elvie strip to appear in print. To celebrate
five years of creating these monthly cartoons, Mark wrote an in-depth article about the creative process which also appeared in
the same edition. This particularly self-referential strip seemed like a good choice to run alongside the article, to reinforce
the notion that anyone can create their own webcomic using Free and Open Source Software - or just download the source files 
for the Elvie cartoons and modify them instead.
