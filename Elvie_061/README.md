Elvie #061
==========
This strip first appeared in issue #221 of Linux (Pro) Magazine, shortly after Microsoft announced that Edge, their web
browser, was to switch from their internally developed rendering engine to "Blink", the engine used by Google Chrome.
Like many people, we're concerned that this gives Google too much control over the future of the web platform, raising
the same sort of concerns we had in the bad old days when Internet Explorer was dominant. This cartoon is our response.

If you don't want to end up in a web monoculture, where one company (that has a vested interest in selling adverts)
gets to dictate the direction of the market, we urge you to use Firefox where you can.
