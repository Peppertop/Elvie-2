Elvie #068
==========
This strip first appeared in issue #228 of Linux (Pro) Magazine, and is inspired by the concerns of every artist or
designer who has ever used FOSS tools to create their work, but then have to send them to a bureau or print shop that
is tooled entirely around the "industry standard" Adobe products.
