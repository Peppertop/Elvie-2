Elvie #069
==========
This strip first appeared in issue #229 of Linux (Pro) Magazine, and is the second in a trilogy of strips following
Elvie's efforts to make some money by selling some geeky merchandise. In a change from our usual panel layout and
style, this strip showcases some of her designs, rather than focusing on a single narrative joke.

------------
* 069_panel_1.ora     - The original MyPaint image used for the T-shirts.

* Elvie_069.svg       - The Inkscape SVG file that combines the t-shirt images, vector images and text to create the comic.
