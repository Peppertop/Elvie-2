Elvie #070
==========
This strip first appeared in issue #230 of Linux (Pro) Magazine, and is the last in a trilogy of strips following
Elvie's efforts to make some money by selling some geeky merchandise. This is one of our favourite strips â€“ possibly because it could so easily have been a Greys strip instead (but you would have had to wait a lot longer for us to produce that one!).
