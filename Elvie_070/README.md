Elvie #070
==========
This strip first appeared in issue #229 of Linux (Pro) Magazine, and is the second in a trilogy of strips following
Elvie's efforts to make some money by selling some geeky merchandise. In a change from our usual panel layout and
style, this strip showcases some of her designs, rather than focusing on a single narrative joke.
