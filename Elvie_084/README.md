Elvie #084
==========
This strip first appeared in issue #244 of Linux (Pro) Magazine. It was inspired by the kids in the Code Club that I run. They're aged between 7 and 11, and universally believe that the '#' character is called 'a hashtag'. No amount of explanation or historical insight seems able to shift them from this viewpoint. I therefore predict that eventually the de facto name for this character will become 'hashtag', and all other names will be considered archaic.
