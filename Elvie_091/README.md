Elvie #091
==========
This strip first appeared in issue #251 of Linux (Pro) Magazine. It's the first of a pair of strips that summarise
the dismay I feel every time I see a product that requires a closed-source app that uses proprietary protocols in
order to access the full functionality of the device.


File Details
------------
* 091_panel_n.ora     - The original MyPaint image used for panel n in the strip.
* 091_panel_n.png     - A PNG image, exported from the ORA file for panel n using The GIMP.
* Elvie_091.svg       - The Inkscape SVG file that combines the panel images with frames and text to create the comic.
