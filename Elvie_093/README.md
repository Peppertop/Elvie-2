Elvie #093
==========
This strip first appeared in issue #253 of Linux (Pro) Magazine. Usually Mark writes these strips, Vince draws the images, then
it's back to Mark for final editing and assembly. This strip is unusual in that Mark also did the drawing - only the second
Elvie strip for which that has been the case.
