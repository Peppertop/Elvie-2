Elvie #095
==========
This strip first appeared in issue #255 of Linux (Pro) Magazine, in November 2021 when the price of Bitcoin was approaching
an all-time high (it reached $69k that month). The gag doesn't actually depend on Bitcoin being valuable or popular,
but it certainly helped to explain why Elvie would be prepared to put so much money into a mining rig at that time.
