Elvie #096
==========
This strip first appeared in issue #256 of Linux (Pro) Magazine. It refers to the fact that Apple's Safari is effectively
the only browser available on iOS. There are other browsers available, but Apple's restrictive rules require them all to
use the same WebKit rendering engine used by Safari. In other words, they may appear to be different in their user
interfaces, but when it comes to the technical aspects of how to draw a web page on the screen, they all use the same
code beneath the surface. This prevents competition and stifles innovation.

There are signs that the European Union may force Apple to allow competing browsers, with different rendering engines.
But that requirement has not yet been enshrined in law, and it's not yet clear whether Apple would extend any such
freedom to other parts of the world.
