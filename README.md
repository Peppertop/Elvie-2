Elvie
=====

This repository contains the source files for the Elvie cartoon that appears in Linux (Pro) Magazine.

Elvie originally appeared in the now-defunct Linux Voice magazine. If you are looking for the source
files for any of the first 33 cartoons, please visit our other repository (where you can also find
the fonts that we use in all the strips):
