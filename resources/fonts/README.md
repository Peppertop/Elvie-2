About the Fonts
===============

Although there are lots of "free as in beer" fonts available, there is a distinct lack of Open Source fonts. This goes doubly for comic fonts, which has limited our options somewhat.

We have endeavoured to use fonts in our Elvie strips that are at least free for us to redistribute. Please check the licence included with each font, however, before using them for other projects.

The main fonts used in our comics are "Komika Axis" and "Komika Text". These can be found in the "resources" folder at the
root of our first Elvie repository (where the first 33 strips can also be found):

* Comic Neue Bold - Used in Elvie #33 to give a more authentic appearance to the speech bubble of the
                    character inspired by an XKCD comic. See that strip's README.md for more details.
