About the Fonts
===============

Although there are lots of "free as in beer" fonts available, there is a distinct lack of Open Source fonts. This goes doubly for comic fonts, which has limited our options somewhat.

We have endeavoured to use fonts in our Elvie strips that are at least free for us to redistribute. Please check the licence included with each font, however, before using them for other projects.

The main fonts used in our comics are "Komika Axis" and "Komika Text". These can be found in the "resources" folder at the
root of our first Elvie repository (where the first 33 strips can also be found):

List of Fonts
-------------

* Comic Neue Bold - Used in Elvie #33 to give a more authentic appearance to the speech bubble of the character inspired by an XKCD comic. See that strip's README.md for more details.

* Anton - Used in Elvie #54 for the heading of the "Ocean's 8" film poster. See that strip's README.md for more details.

* Kalam Bold - Used in Elvie #54 to give Bob's handwriting a different style to the rest of the text in the strip. Original source: https://github.com/itfoundry/kalam
